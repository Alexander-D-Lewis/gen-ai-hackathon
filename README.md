Resources: https://no10ds.github.io/evidence-house/events/gen-ai-hack/challenges/evaluation/evaluation.html

### Our problem statement:
*"How do we use Gen AI to learn from past international development and policy projects to improve current and future projects?"*

### Approach
* build basic pipeline
* consider how to add value above and beyond MVP
> * e.g. meta-data tagging
> * e.g. prompt-engineering
> * e.g. Claude vs Chat-GPT context window
> * e.g. enhancing user query
